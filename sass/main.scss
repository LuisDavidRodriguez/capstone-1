/// Author note: since I was working in my portfolio project I realized the difficulties I
/// was getting as soon as the css file pass 1000 lines. It was an awful chore add classes
/// or perform a new change, so I decided to go out in a limb and implement SASS in this
/// project from the very beginning, I been watching videos since 2 weeks ago so I feel enough
/// confidence to create this project whith SASS.
/// I hope that you can fall in love with my work ;)
///
/// (SASS is not easy you need to master first the basic css and then implement SASS
/// in that way you know what exactly are you doing and the way SASS will be transcribed into your
/// normal css)
///
/// I got a lot of inspiration and help from these sources:
/// 7:1 structure SASS boilerplate
/// ===> https://github.com/KittyGiraudel/sass-boilerplate/tree/master/stylesheets
///
/// Import typography
/// ===> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAU25Fo4bFY&t=378s
///
/// STOP from using @import which is deprecated and implement @use and @forward
/// ===> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CR-a8upNjJ0
/// ===> https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use
///
/// How to create breackpoint mixin
/// in this same source you can see the way they create a function with a fantastic @if @else which
/// validate if the map has a key if not create a warn! it is amazing.
/// therefore I implement that way into my _functions parcial
/// ===> https://css-tricks.com/snippets/sass/mixin-manage-breakpoints/
///
/// Fabolous creation of a portfolio with SASS and using a beautiful animation
/// to convert the burger icon into a cross

/// Create a grid sistem
