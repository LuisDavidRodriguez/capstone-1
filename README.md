## Features
### Developed entirely using SASS using the 7:1 structure you can see my files here [SASS](https://github.com/LuisDavidRodriguez/capstone-1/tree/main/sass)

- I create my own grid system very similar to Bootstrap (**I am not using Bootstrap**), that allows me to understand all the ways in which the libraries works inside libraries [grid-system](https://github.com/LuisDavidRodriguez/capstone-1/blob/main/sass/2_base/_grid-system.scss)

- This project gave me the opportunity to learn a lot of SASS functions, maps, mixins, partials so i took advantaje of them!

**Dear reviewer take a time to see the subtle animation in the patterns into the welcome section of the home and about page there are 5 patterns each one change to color one each time**
[Here is my partial](https://github.com/LuisDavidRodriguez/capstone-1/blob/main/sass/4_components/_stars.scss)
and [my documentation to sincronyze the animations](https://ibritech.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/~864961965/pages/231374901/Capstone-1)

# Show more and hide buttons working
To achieve this I create the object CardsManager yo can find it in [my JavaScript folder](https://github.com/LuisDavidRodriguez/capstone-1/tree/main/js) or [directly here](https://github.com/LuisDavidRodriguez/capstone-1/blob/main/js/cardManager.js)


#### In movile it displays only 3 cards and when you click the button it shows 3 cards at the time

####  Whilst in desktop it displays 6 cards with step of 6 at the time

#### once you reach the end of the 20 cards you will see a hide button

### Moreover the javaScrip part as a listner when the window change from dektop triggers a reload of the cards and show the correct step with out necessity of reload it.
